      <p>Hi!  I'm Marina Wooden - an Informatics student at the University of Washington.  I focus mostly on software development, especially anything related to the web.  I also have a personal interest in data analysis, and figuring out things that are going on in the world by analyzing them on my own.  I got into coding by creating templates for blogs in high school, and then I eventually found out that I could also use technology to <a href="#current-events">explore current events in the world</a> that I'm passionate about.</p>
      <p>In addition to being a student, I am also a TA for Web Programming (CSE 154) at the UW.  It's my favorite job that I've had so far, and I love being able to teach other people about one of my greatest interests.  If you're reading this and you were/are in my section- HI!</p>

          <p>I have an interest in old, geocities-era personal homepages, and something I noticed was a lot of these websites have a 88x31 button to advertise themselves.  I thought it would be nice to create a website to make it easy to create these buttons from scratch</p>

          <p>Simple website builder, allows users with minimal exposure to web programming concepts to simply create a website.  I made it when I noticed there were a lot of people online who wanted websites but didn't have a need to learn html or css.</p>

          <h3>An Analysis of Native American Children in Foster Care in Clark County, WA</h3>
          <time>2021</time>
          <p>In the summer of 2021, I worked with public defenders to create a data visualization to map discrepancies between Native and non-Native American children in the foster care system in Clark County, WA.  My findings were used in court to achieve better outcomes for foster care placements for Native American children.</p>

          <time>2020</time>
          <p>As a part of my introduction to data science, I worked with a database of police killings to map where they were occuring and who was being targeted.  Through working on this I was not only able to visualize this phenomenon, but also understand it on my own to a higher degree.</p>
